# My Personal Project

## Music tuner and song composer in Java
The application will work as a music tuner, given a sound input (initially modeled as a frequency value on
console input), and will also allow the user to compose music and play it back later. 

## User Stories
### REALIZED USER STORIES:
- As a user, I want to be able to compose music pieces of varying lengths of single notes only.
(arbitrary number of notes, added to a piece)
- As a user, I want to be able to play back composed pieces and see the piece on screen.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the progress of my piece as I compose it. 
- As a user, I want to be able to see how long each piece composed is.
- As a user, I want to be able to go back to pieces that I have composed earlier within the session and edit or modify
- those pieces. 
- As a user, I want to be able to save composed pieces to a memory for playback later.
- As a user, I want to be able to go back to pieces I have composed earlier and load them from memory to edit, modify,
- and/or playback.

### Not yet realized user stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to compose music with notes with different instrument sounds in the same piece.


## Stretch goals:
- Tuner program: (More complex because requires Fourier Transforms to read frequencies)
- As a user, I want to be able to tune my instruments to the correct pitch using the middle C scale of notes.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the history of the notes I have tuned.

- Minigame:
- Potentially add a minigame where the user will need to playback a series of notes, with a few select
- difficulties. Correctly playing back the notes will earn points which will be displayed at the end of the game.
- Game will end once X amount of notes are successfully played back or Y amount of wrong notes are played back.
