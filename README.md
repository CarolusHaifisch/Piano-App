# My Personal Project

## Music tuner and song composer in Java
The application will work as a music tuner, given a sound input (initially modeled as a frequency value on
console input), and will also allow the user to compose music and play it back later. 

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to tune my instruments to the correct pitch. 
- As a user, I want to be able to view the history of the notes I have tuned. 
- As a user, I want to be able to compose music pieces of varying lengths of single notes only.
(arbitrary number of notes, added to a piece)
- As a user, I want to be able to save composed pieces to a memory for playback later. 
- As a user, I want to be able to see how long each piece composed is.
- As a user, I want to be able to compose music with notes with different instrument sounds in the same piece.
